# Cloud Foundry Service Broker for Kaltura VPaaS

This is a [Cloud Foundry Service Broker](https://www.openservicebrokerapi.org/) for provisioning of Kaltura VPaaS accounts on Cloud Foundry based PaaS providers. CF PaaS based cloud vendors and cloud admins using Cloud Foundry can utilize this project to streamline accounts provisioning of Kaltura VPaaS accounts. 

This project is written in Go and is relies on the [Pivotal CF BrokerAPI](https://github.com/pivotal-cf/brokerapi) and [Go-CF Environment](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-community/go-cfenv) libraries.

# How To

To run this project you will need to have access to a Cloud Foundry based PaaS. For example the [SAP Cloud Platform](https://cloudplatform.sap.com/index.html).  
You will also need to have [Go-lang](https://golang.org/) and [Go-dep](https://golang.github.io/dep/) installed, and ensure that `~/go/bin` is in your PATH.

* Run `go get github.com/kaltura/kaltura-cloud-foundry-service-broker`
* Run `cd ~/go/src/github.com/kaltura/kaltura-cloud-foundry-service-broker` (`~/go/` being the directory where go get is configured to download repos to)
* Edit `manifest.yml` and configure your desired username and password.
* Run `dep ensure`
* Then run the cf commands to add the new service and bind it to your apps.
* Or use this code as basis reference example to implementing a new generic Kaltura service in your Cloud Foundry Cloud offering.
